# NebulusDB Roadmap

## Cloud-Themed Releases
Starting with v0.2.2, all NebulusDB releases are named after types of clouds, reflecting our commitment to building a database that's as flexible and powerful as the sky.

- **Altocumulus**: Mid-level cloud formations that appear as white or gray patches, often in layers or waves—just like our layered architecture and wave of new features.
- **Billow**: Rolling, wave-like clouds, representing the next wave of improvements.
- **Cirrus**: High, wispy clouds, symbolizing lightness, speed, and forward vision.
