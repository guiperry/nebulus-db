# NebulusDB Simple Demo

This demo showcases the power and flexibility of NebulusDB, a TypeScript-first embedded database with reactive queries.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Database Creation** - Setting up a NebulusDB instance with a memory adapter
2. **Schema Definition** - Creating strongly-typed collections with schemas
3. **Indexing** - Setting up indexes for optimized queries
4. **CRUD Operations** - Insert, find, update, and delete operations
5. **Complex Queries** - Using query operators like `$lt`, `$gt`, `$contains`
6. **Reactive Queries** - Real-time updates when data changes
7. **Performance** - Benchmarking insert and query operations

## Running the Demo

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the demo:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What to Expect

The demo will:

1. Create a database with users and posts collections
2. Insert sample data
3. Perform various queries to demonstrate NebulusDB's capabilities
4. Show how reactive queries work
5. Benchmark performance with bulk operations
6. Display final database statistics
